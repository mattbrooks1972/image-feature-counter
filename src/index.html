			This tool allows you to upload an image and click on it to create marks, which will be automatically counted.
			This could be useful for counting the number of features on an uploaded image.
			Additionally, the color and size of the marks can be changed, the opacity of the under image can be changed, and marks (and their count) can be undone.
